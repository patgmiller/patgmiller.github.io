## Before

![Patrick &amp; Raylene](/images/2008/12/dsc_9131_edited-1-modified11-300x199.jpg)

I currently live in Utah and was born in California. I am happily married to my wife, and best friend, Raylene. We were married on Friday January, 24 2003 in the [Oakland, California Temple](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/details/oakland-california-temple) of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

We have two rather exuberant and imaginative children Olivia and Zachariah. Raylene and I pretty much jumped into parenthood with them, after bringing them home I coined this phrase for my parenting motto:

> Halfhearted compliance is better than wholehearted defiance!

We are all still alive and each day is a new adventure. I must admit I once had parenting theories that I thought were sound and well grounded ... I no longer have any theories. <i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile-wink"></i>

## Now

Fast-forward 10+ years, so much has happened! The kids grew a few inches, I grew a few inches, and life just keeps on moving. Yes, we're all still alive!
