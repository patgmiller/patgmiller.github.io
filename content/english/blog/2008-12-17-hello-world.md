Hello fellow webbers! It feels good to finally have some web space where I can get my geek on.
<!--more-->
My beginnings started as a college student at Utah State University with the on campus Help Desk. I had been working there six months taking phone calls and troubleshooting users Windows and Macintosh problems while getting my undergrad in Computer Engineering. Then a position opened up to assist in programming on their Help Desk Admin Site in PHP and I jumped on it because although customer support is important, it doesn't hold a candle to the _sweet nectar_ of programming, also I'm better with machines than with people. Now here I am about three and half years later with a Bachelors in Computer Engineering and working for the USU Information Technology department on the Programming &amp; Design team and programming in PHP, Coldfusion, and Python.

Why did I wait so long so long to join the interwebs? Being a married college student in engineering doesn't leave much time for tinkering. So here goes nothing!
