My daughter, Olivia, has of late been growing like some plant that has been sprayed with Miracle Grow. Which also means nearly all of her clothes are too small and most of the jeans have holes in one or both of the knees. In addition to that she has been really into wearing dresses lately so she's been looking kinda hussy and creates a problem when Raylene or I tell her she can't wear her favorite clothes because they are too small.

So made a run to Dessert Industries (DI) for my lunch break and found 2 skirts, 2 capri's, 2 pants, and 3 shirts that were about her size and what I thought Raylene and Livy would consider 'cute'. After returning home and presenting my spoils Livy was glowing and Raylene was quite impressed that I manage to buy clothes that fit, were 'cute', and inexpensive. What can I say, except 'no extra charge for awesomeness'!
